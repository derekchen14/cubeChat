  <h3>About Us</h3>
  <p>CubeChat is a super simple to use chat application.  There is no need to login or sign up, no hassle of remembering passwords or long forms to fill out - just <a href="/" ng-click="flip('name')">tell us your name</a> and go!</p>
  <p>To navigate, flip the cube by clicking on any of the four arrows at each side of the cube.  The cube will then rotate in that direction. On a mobile device, swiping will turn the cube as well. There's no wrong way to do it!  With just six sides, you're always just a couple clicks away from where you want to go.</p>
  <p>This app is mainly for demoing the possibilities of a real-time web application built with AngularJS, MongoDB, and NodeJS, otherwise known as a MEAN stack app.  Flip over to the <a href="/" ng-click="flip('tech')">technology side</a> to learn more about the skills used to build this app.</p>
  <p>The creator of this app is Derek Chen.  He is a full-stack web developer with a passion for improving education and building great products that allow people to pursue their dreams.  Any inquiries can be directed at me by emailing derekchen 14 at gmail.</p>
